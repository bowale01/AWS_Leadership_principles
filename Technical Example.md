CUSTOMER OBESSION 

Describe a situations when you have a very difficult customer or describe a situations where you negotiated a win win 

1) Situation: An e-commerce company suffers downtime and performance issues during peak seasons, causing revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction due to an inability to handle traffic spikes.

Task: As a DevOps engineer, enhance the website's reliability and performance during peak periods by implementing AWS solutions to improve customer trust and satisfaction through better performance.

Action :
Scalable Architecture: Use AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic EC2 instances and ELB for traffic distribution.
CDN: Deploy Amazon CloudFront to cache static content and reduce origin load.
Database Optimization: Migrate to Amazon RDS with read replicas and use DynamoDB for high-demand, low-latency data.
Monitoring and Alerts: Implement Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerts.
Disaster Recovery: Use multi-AZ deployment and AWS Backup for high availability and quick recovery.
Cost Management: Utilize AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor, and apply Reserved Instances or Savings Plans.


Result:
Improved Reliability: Scalable infrastructure and optimized performance increase availability during peak periods.
Enhanced User Experience: Reduced downtime and faster load times boost customer satisfaction and trust.
Business Impact: Improved website performance leads to higher revenue retention and customer loyalty, aligning with AWS's Customer Obsession principle by prioritizing customer needs and satisfaction.


2) Situation: The customer used On-Demand instances for development and staging, leading to high operational costs.

Task: My role was to reduce their costs while maintaining stability and efficiency.

Action: I analyzed their usage and recommended switching to Spot Instances. I explained the benefits and risks, guided them through the transition, and monitored the process to address any issues.

Result: The customer significantly reduced their costs without workflow disruption, stayed within budget, and our relationship strengthened due to our proactive support and commitment.
